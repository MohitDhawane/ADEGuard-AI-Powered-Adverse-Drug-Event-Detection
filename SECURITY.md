Our Commitment
When you report a vulnerability to us, you can expect the following:

A timely response, typically within 48 hours, to acknowledge that we have received your report.

An open and transparent process as we work to investigate and resolve the issue. We will keep you updated on our progress.

Public recognition for your contribution after the vulnerability has been fixed, if you so desire.
